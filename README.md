# Autohighlighting brought to vim.

This is a feature that most modern IDEs have that I found I missed when in vim.

This whole plugin was ripped from [this vim wiki page](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Auto_highlight_current_word_when_idle),
but I wanted to put it in version control.

## Installation

Use [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
